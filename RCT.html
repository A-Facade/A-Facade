									<h2>Lore</h2>
									<p>Rioma is a princess from a very rich kingdom, her kingdom is ruled by her father, who is an overbearing king. When Rioma was abducted she couldn’t believe it, she would finally get her happy ending when her knight arrives to save her, they would run away together. So she waited, and waited, and waited, she wasn’t sure how long it had been, but when she finally heard her knight calling out to her she was ecstatic, she had prepared for this. She knew exactly where the Maid put her ladder that she used to access the roof for cleaning, it was outside now even, she yelled out calling to him, asking him to use the ladder. “No, I am a the greatest knight in the land, I have no need for ladders or your help Princess, so just wait for me up there and don’t worry your pretty little head about it” Rioma couldn’t understand, the ladder was right there, he could use it and they would both be done with this ordeal, and what did he mean ‘don’t worry your pretty little head about it’, well she was worrying as she watched that insolent idiot stand right in front of the castles open entrance, mumbling to himself, she called out to him once more, asking him what was he doing. “I’m practising my speech to the king about how great I am and how I deserve all the riches I desire” Riches? That wasn’t something that she wanted to hear, he didn’t come out here for honour or even for her hand. Money. Is all he wanted, she couldn’t rely on him to save her. The minute it becomes too dangerous for him, he will leave quickly and quietly. She had to escape by herself now.</p>
