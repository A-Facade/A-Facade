Hi, Iâ€™m Shaun Davis!

I'm a university student that's currently learning game programming
On my GitHub, you'll probably only find my website portfolio for now, but in the future I plan to upload the code for games I have made

If you want to speak to me to give me any helpful advice or just to talk to me about games, then you can contact me on my twitter or my LinkedIn (Both can be found in my website portfolio, or in the linktree below, including my website)
